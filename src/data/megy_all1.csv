In a second step, 0.67 g (2.22 mmol) of Co(stearate)2 dissolved in 20 mL of octadecene was added to the remaining solution kept at 100 ï¿½C, and the mixture containing both octyl ether and octadecene was heated again to reflux for 3 h under argon (heating rate of 1 ï¿½C min?1). After cooling down to room temperature, nanoparticles were precipitated by the addition of an excess of acetone and washed three times by a mixture of hexane/acetone (1/4) followed by centrifugation (14 000 rpm, 10 mn). Nanoparticles were then easily dispersed in THF. Further, a solution of (12-azidododecyl) phosphonic acid (AP12) (15 mg dissolved in THF (10 mL)) was added to 10 mL of the nanoparticle suspension and stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Free molecules were removed by ultrafiltration (using a 30 kDa membrane, Millipore) in 60 mL of THF and allowed preparing an Fe3??O4@CoO@N3 suspension in THF (1 mg mL?1)"

After the reaction product had been stirred, it was washed with deionized (DI) water to eliminate any remnants before being centrifuged in a solution of 50% ethanol.

Next, our previously established hydrothermal nanophase epitaxy procedure was utilized to grow the Mn- and Co-bearing oxide phases over the NiO core. First, MnCl2.3H2O and CoCl2.6H2O (2:1) were added to deionized water that had been purged with N2 for 15 to 20 minutes at a temperature between 70 and 80 ï¿½C. Drops of HCl or NaOH were used to modify the pH of the solution around 5. Previously, it was found in our lab that at pH values trending from low acidic to neutral, nanoparticles having enhanced magnetic properties and the highest magnetization was found for core-shell nanoparticles synthesized at a pH of 5.0.Thus, we maintained the pH value of the hydrothermal solution at 5.06 to 5.3. Next, 0.33g of NiO nanoparticles were added to an aqueous solution containing 0.08M of Mn and Co salts. Following the addition of NiO nanoparticles to the Mn-Co chloride solution, the mixture was sonicated for 30 minutes before being placed in an autoclave.

In this study, the central gas nozzle has two concentric tubes with the central one used for reactive mixture of 2.5 mm internal diameter. The synthetic air was used as oxygen source, Fe(CO)5 vapors as iron sources and the pressure in the reaction chamber was 300 mbar. The focal spot size was kept constant at 2 mm. The iron oxide nanoparticles labeled here by sample A were prepared at a laser power of 45 W, while the temperature was 515 ï¿½C. The ethane flow (100 sccm) has a double role: of carrier gas for Fe(CO)5 vapors and of sensitizer at CO2 laser wave-length. The synthetic air flow was also 100 sccm. An Ar flow of 2000 sccm was introduced in the external nozzle tube, while two equal Ar flows of 150 sccm each were introduced on sides in order to flush the ZnSe windows. Annealing treatments in hydrogen atmosphere were performed at 300 ï¿½C. The heat treatment under hydrogen was performed using an apparatus based on stainless steel tubing. Prior to annealing, the tubes were degassed for 2 h at 300 ï¿½C under 10ï¿½3 mbar. The samples were annealed afterwards for 4 h at the above temperatures in flowing hydrogen gas (99.9999% purity, 100 ml/min flow rate)."

In this research, analytical grade chemicals were used. For the reaction, NaOH (SD Fine-Chem Limited, 98%) was taken as the base and ethylene glycol (AR, Merck) as theï¿½surfactant. Hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4ï¿½H2O, Merck) is the reducing agent used for the reduction of nickel. The required amount of reducing agent was added to the ethylene glycol mixed NaOH solution with subsequent heating to a temperature of 80?ï¿½C on a magnetic stirrer. After keeping the temperature 80?ï¿½C, surfactant mixed NiCl2.6H2O (High Purity Laboratory Chemicals, 98%) is added drop by drop, which initially resulted in green colour and progressively changed to grey-black. The reduced NNPs were sticking to the magnetic bead, leaving out a clear supernatant solution.ï¿½BaTiO3 nanoparticles were prepared via a chemical route. In a typical synthesis, TiCl4 solution (Alfa Aesar) was used as the titanium source. This solution was added to an absolute ethanol solution to form a yellow solution. This aqueous solution was heated gradually up to 80 1C; then, a transparent solution was formed. To this, BaCl22H2O solution was added dropwise. Finally, 1.2 M NaOH solution was added to complete the reaction. The mixture was kept at 80 1C for 2 h. The resulting product was repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 60 1C for 5 h. The calcination was carried out at a temperature of 600 0C. The magnetic separation was employed to collect the products, subjected to repeated washing using distilled water and ethanol, with subsequent drying under vacuum at a temperature of 60ï¿½C for 15 h."

A 0.2 M aqueous solution of chromium nitrate was made using commercially available Cr(NO3)3?9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and HPLC water. The water was first deoxygenated by passing dry nitrogen gas through it at ~60 ï¿½C. Next, triethanolamine (TEOA) was added to the aqueous solution in 1:2 molar ratio. This mixture was magnetically stirred for 1 hour and subsequently cooked in a microwave oven for 5 minutes. The aqueous solution was then magnetically stirred for 10 minutes and then heated in the microwave oven for 4 minutes. This cycle was repeated four times after which the solution was left on top of a magnet until a dark green colored precipitate was formed at the bottom of the beaker. The harvested precipitate was then heated to evaporate the water resulting in the formation of a thick slurry. The slurry was subsequently calcined at a temperature of 750 oC for 5 hours in the presence of atmosphere. Upon calcination, the sample formed into a dark-green colored nano powder. For CSN synthesis, a 0.05 M aqueous solution was prepared from  transition metal chlorides MnCl2 using HPLC water; the ambient-condition solution pH was typically adjusted to be below 6.5. Then, ~0.3 g of Cr2O3 nanoparticles were added to the solution, sonicated for 20 minutes and subsequently loaded in a Teflon reactor and hydrothermally treated at 200 ï¿½C for 13 hours. After hydrothermal treatment, the CSN were rinsed and harvested. The harvested CSNs were subsequently calcined at 500 ï¿½C for ~2 hours. "
1003,0.205,0.0095,42.0,"The Cr2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by using the procedure described by Farzaneh et el. A 0.2 M aqueous solution of chromium nitrate was made using commercially available Cr(NO3)3?9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and HPLC water. The water was first deoxygenated by passing dry nitrogen gas through it at ~60 ï¿½C. Next, triethanolamine (TEOA) was added to the aqueous solution in 1:2 molar ratio. This mixture was magnetically stirred for 1 hour and subsequently cooked in a microwave oven for 5 minutes. The aqueous solution was then magnetically stirred for 10 minutes and then heated in the microwave oven for 4 minutes. This cycle was repeated four times after which the solution was left on top of a magnet until a dark green colored precipitate was formed at the bottom of the beaker. The harvested precipitate was then heated to evaporate the water resulting in the formation of a thick slurry. The slurry was subsequently calcined at a temperature of 750 oC for 5 hours in the presence of atmosphere. Upon calcination, the sample formed into a dark-green colored nano powder. For CSN synthesis, a 0.05 M aqueous solution was prepared from  transition metal chlorides MnCl2 using HPLC water; the ambient-condition solution pH was typically adjusted to be below 6.5. Then, ~0.3 g of Cr2O3 nanoparticles were added to the solution, sonicated for 20 minutes and subsequently loaded in a Teflon reactor and hydrothermally treated at 200 ï¿½C for 13 hours.
